# Heart Disease Prediction 

## Overview
Heart disease is a significant public health concern globally, with early detection playing a crucial role in improving patient outcomes. This project aims to develop a predictive model that can accurately classify whether a patient is at risk of developing heart disease based on various health indicators and medical attributes. By leveraging machine learning techniques, the goal is to assist healthcare professionals in identifying high-risk individuals early on, enabling timely intervention and personalized treatment plans.

## Introduction
Heart disease continues to be a leading cause of morbidity and mortality worldwide, underscoring the critical need for proactive healthcare interventions. While medical science has made significant strides, timely identification of individuals susceptible to heart ailments remains paramount for effective management and prevention. In response to this pressing need, this project harnesses the power of data science and machine learning to develop a predictive model for heart disease classification.

## Project Structure

- `notebooks/`: Jupyter notebooks for data exploration, modeling, and evaluation.
- `README.md`: Overview of the project, including problem statement, introduction, and usage instructions.
- `requirements.txt`: List of dependencies required to run the project.

## Data
The dataset used in this project contains a comprehensive set of patient attributes, including demographic information, medical history, and clinical measurements.

## Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) is conducted to understand the characteristics of the data, identify patterns, and uncover insights that may inform the modeling process.

## Modeling
The modeling phase involves training machine learning algorithms on the dataset to develop a predictive model for heart disease classification. Various algorithms such as logistic regression, decision trees, random forests, and gradient boosting are explored to identify the most suitable model.

## Evaluation
The trained models are evaluated using appropriate performance metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, F1-score, and ROC-AUC. Model performance is assessed on both training and testing datasets to ensure generalizability and robustness.

## Conclusion
In conclusion, this project represents a significant step forward in the realm of predictive healthcare analytics, particularly in the domain of heart disease prediction. Through meticulous data analysis, model training, and evaluation, we have successfully developed a robust classification model capable of accurately identifying individuals at risk of heart disease.
